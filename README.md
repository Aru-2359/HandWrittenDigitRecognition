# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Logistic Regressionüìùüìù

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using logistic regression. The model is trained to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of:

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image is 28x28 pixels.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), used for evaluating the model.

The dataset is widely used for training and testing machine learning models in the field of image recognition.

## Model Architecture

Logistic regression is used as a simple yet effective model for this task:

- **Input**: Each image is flattened into a vector of size 784 (28x28).
- **Output**: Logistic regression outputs probabilities for each digit class (0-9).

## Files
